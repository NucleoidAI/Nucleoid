## What is Nucleoid?

Nucleoid is a low-code framework for Node.js. As writing just like any other codes in Node.js, it rerenders the very same JavaScript codes and makes
the necessary adjustments in the state as well as stores on the disk, so that your application doesn't require external database or anything else.

### ..but why?

Even simple applications today require lots of coding, libraries, tuning etc., and majority of them are technical
requirements rather than business logic. Declarative runtimes like Nucleoid lets you immediately start writing business
logic with less code lines.

## Hello World

```javascript
const nucleoid = require("nucleoidjs");
const app = nucleoid();

class User {constructor(name){this.name = name}}
nucleoid.register(User);

// ðŸ‘‡ This is it!
app.post("/users", () => new User("Daphne"));

app.listen(3000);
```

It is pretty much it, you successfully persisted your first object with this :point_up_2:

> Just the reminder, you don't need external database, `const app = nucleoid()` will do the magic. :sunglasses:
