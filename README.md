  Low-code Framework for Node.js: Building APIs with the help of AI and built-in datastore
</p>

<br/>

As writing just like any other codes in Node.js, AI inside the runtime rerenders the very same JavaScript codes and makes the necessary adjustments in the state as well as stores on the disk so that your application doesn't require external database or anything else. In short, the runtime translates your business logic to fully working application with the built-in datastore.

## How it works

I. Write your business logic in JavaScript (TypeScript support coming soon)

II. Nucleoid runtime renders your codes with AI

III. Creates APIs with built-in datastore

<br/>

## Hello World :zap:

```shell
> npm i nucleoidjs
```

Once installed, you can simply run with Express.js

```javascript
const nucleoid = require("nucleoidjs");
const app = nucleoid();

class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
nucleoid.register(User);

// üëá This is it!
app.post("/users", () => {
  new User("Daphne");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

> :bulb: **This is pretty much it, thanks to [Nucleoid runtime](https://nucleoid.com/docs/runtime/), only with this :point_up_2:, you successfully persisted your first object without external database.**

### Under the hood: Declarative Runtime Environment

Nucleoid is a declarative runtime environment that applies declarative programming at the runtime as rerendering JavaScript statements and creating the graph. The declarative runtime isolates a behavior definition of a program from its technical instructions and executes declarative statements, which represent logical intention without carrying any technical detail.

In this paradigm, there is no segregation regarding what data is or not, instead approaches how data is related with others so that any type of data including business rules can be added without requiring any additional actions such as compiling, configuring, restarting as a result of plasticity.

## OpenAPI Integration with Nucleoid IDE

Nucleoid IDE is a web interface that helps to run very same npm package with OpenAPI.

## Benchmark

This is the comparation our sample order app in Nucleoid IDE against MySQL and Postgres with using Express.js and Sequelize libraries.

<img src="https://cdn.nucleoid.com/media/benchmark.png" alt="Benchmark" width="550" />

> Performance benchmark happened in t2.micro of AWS EC2 instance and both databases had dedicated server with <u>no indexes and default configurations</u>.

https://github.com/NucleoidJS/benchmark

This does not necessary mean Nucleoid runtime is faster than MySQL or Postgres, instead databases require constant maintenance by DBA teams with indexing, caching, purging etc. however, Nucleoid tries to solve this problem with managing logic and data internally. As seen in the chart, for applications with average complexity, Nucleoid's performance is close to linear because of on-chain data store as well as in-memory computing model.

Thanks to declarative programming, we have a brand-new approach to data and logic. As we are still discovering what we can do with this powerful programming model, please join us with any types of contribution!
